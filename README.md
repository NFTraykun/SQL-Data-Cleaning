# SQL-Data-Cleaning
Cleaning Housing Data in SQL

In this project, I have written code in SQL to clean and better arrange this data to make it easier to draw insights.

The SQL code that I wrote and also the data I used are all provided in this GitHub Repository.

P.S.
The SQL code is written in blocks with two dashes '--' at the top of each one followed by a comment of a short explanation for what each piece of code does.
